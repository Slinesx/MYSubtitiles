00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,700
 啊啊 啊 啊 啊 
 Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah

9
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,140
  我愿为你而死
I would die for you

10
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,850
我愿为你而死
 I would die for you

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,820
我的死亡是为了
 I've been dying just to

12
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,430
 感受你在我左右
Feel you by my side

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,370
 来感觉你属于我
To know that you're mine

14
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,200
我愿为你而死
 I would die for you.

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,950
萨姆
-Sam? -Hmm?

17
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,460
聊两句
A quick word?

18
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,630
你用了三个小时
Three hours all in?

19
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,270
我只用了俩小时
I did it in two.

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,470
她送过来时一团糟
She was in bad shape when she came in.

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,470
你做得很好
Good work.

22
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,880
哦 我们到底要聊些什么
Oh, are we having a moment?

23
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,690
你刚来的时候 我以为你干不了一个星期
When you first started here, I didn't think you'd last a week.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,220
是啊 没有了我你可怎么办啊
Yeah, and now, what would you do without me?

25
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,860
虽然你付我的薪水远远不够
-Yeah. -I mean, you don't pay me nearly enough,

26
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,670
但算你走运 我做这一行是因为热爱
but, um, you're lucky I do it for the love of the game.

27
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,340
我能从你工作中看得到
I can see that... in the work.

28
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,850
你是真的在乎
You actually care.

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,790
我认为值得给你加个薪
I think that deserves a raise.

30
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,600
呃 谢谢您
Um, uh, thank you.

31
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,270
我确实在乎
Yeah. I-I do care.

32
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,710
我认为我们的工作很特别
I-I believe what we do here is very special.

33
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,380
继续保持这个势头 萨姆
Keep your head in the game, Sam.

34
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,880
你在这里前途无量
You've got a bright future here.

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,950
谢谢
-Thank you.

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,630
杰西
Jesse?

37
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,970
杰西
Jesse?!

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,780
嗨 你回来了
Hey, you.

39
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,750
-嗨 -我昨晚好想你
-Hi. -Missed you last night.

40
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,590
抱歉 真希望你当时也在场
I'm sorry. I wish you could've seen it.

41
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,900
那家人对我说了谢谢 天啊 太感人了
The family thanked me. God, it was so emotional.

42
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,300
就连亨德森也承认我干的好
Even Henderson had to admit that I did a great job, and then...

43
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,640
他还给我加薪了
-...he offered me a raise. -Hmm.

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,750



45
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,750
听起来 你今天过得不错
It sounds like you had a good day.

46
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,760
是啊
Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,930
今晚给我好好讲讲
You'll have to tell me all about it tonight.

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,330
- 我得走了 开庭要迟到了 -别嘛
-I got to go. I'm late for court. -No.

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,400
来吧 大律师
Come on, Counselor.

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,410
晚几分钟也没关系的
You can be a couple minutes late.

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,410



52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,350
有时候打破常规也会很有趣
Mm, sometimes it's fun to go off script.

53
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,460
谁知道冥冥之中藏着什么惊喜
Maybe the universe will surprise you.

54
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,000
还有人指望着我呢
I've got people depending on me.

55
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,680
我得为受害者报仇 把罪犯绳之以法
Victims to avenge, criminals to put away.

56
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,550
行吧 去拯救世界吧
Okay, well, go save the world or whatever.

57
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,030
不如你去洗个热水澡
Why don't you... go take a nice hot bath

58
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,740
用点我给你买高级薰衣草精油
with some of that fancy lavender oil I got you?

59
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,780
我下班前已经洗过两次了 不过
Showered twice before I left work, but...

60
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,080
估计是我鼻窦太敏感
Maybe it's just my, uh, extra sensitive sinuses,

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,730
但那股甲醛味真的很冲
but that formaldehyde smell is really something.

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,360
拜
-Bye.

63
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,370
待会儿见 宝贝
See you later, babe.

64
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,640
你身上可能是有培根和死亡的味道
Look, you probably smelled like bacon and death.

65
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,940
-这会让人很没性致 -不
-Nobody wants to fuck that. -No, I...

66
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,110
就是心里觉得怪怪的
-It all just felt kind of weird.

67
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,450
是有点怪 如果男人拒绝上床
Yeah, it's weird. If a guy turns down sex,

68
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,020
-感情肯定是出了严重问题 -说不好
-something is seriously wrong. -SAM: Oh, I don't know.

69
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,090
就算我们真的上床了 也感觉
Even when we do have sex, it's just like...

70
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,900
缺了点什么
something's... missing.

71
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,440
总之有点不对劲
It's just something off.

72
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,780
我们两个就像朝不同方向
It's-it's like we're on separate tracks,

73
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,440
前进的两列列车
heading in different directions.

74
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,690
而且 他不会明说 但我知道
And, like, he won't exactly say it, but I know

75
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,490
他不喜欢我在殡仪馆工作
he doesn't like me working at the funeral home.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,660
有时我都怀疑 他是不是真的理解我
And sometimes I just wonder if he even gets me at all.

77
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,030
姑娘 你可是会跟死人说话的
Girl, you talk to dead people, literally.

78
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,500
经营感情意味着妥协
-Relationships are about compromise.

79
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,870
没有十全十美的事儿
Nothing's perfect.

80
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,510
比如 你最近为杰西做了什么
Like, what have you done for Jesse lately?

81
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,910
我
I, uh...

82
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,820
我有时会洗碗
I do the dishes. Sometimes.

83
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,890
想起来时会洗洗衣服
Laundry. When I remember.

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,530
我前几天开了十分钟的车
I drove ten minutes out of the way

85
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,570
买了他最爱吃的冰淇淋
the other day to get his favorite ice cream.

86
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,100
-哇哦 -很可以
-DANI: Wow. -Cool.

87
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,110
如果杰西直接让你选
If Jesse asked you, point blank,

88
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,010
不换工作 就换我
Either the job's got to go, or I do,

89
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,080
你会怎么选
which would you pick?

90
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,760
你犹豫了 杰西真可怜
You hesitated. Poor Jesse.

91
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
不 不 只不过
No, no. It's just, it's...

92
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,770
这很复杂
It's complicated.

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,740
这有什么复杂的
What am I missing?

94
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,180
我是真的很喜欢自己的工作
I really love my job.

95
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,750
我做得也很优秀
And I'm good at it.

96
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,090
而且 你每天都能从逝者身上
And, uh, the deceased teach you

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,890
学到些新东西
something new every day.

98
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,490
如何学
How?

99
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,060
他们都死了
They're dead.

100
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,070
看 秘密就在这
See, that's the secret.

101
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,010
人在死后才是最有意思的
People are the most interesting right after death.

102
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,990
有一次 有个女的突然开始呻吟
One time, this woman started moaning.

103
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,660
她还活着吧
Was she still alive?

104
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,030
死得很彻底
Totally dead.

105
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,900
在尸体分解过程中 气体会积聚在―起
Gases-- they can build up during decomposition,

106
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,700
越积越多时 会从嘴中排出
and when they try to escape, sometimes it hits

107
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,010
有时气流会撞击到声带
vocal cords on the way out of the mouth.

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,940
有时血液会向下面聚集
Sometimes the blood rushes all the way down.

109
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,950
还会导致死者勃起
A decedent will come in with a boner.

110
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,480
好恶心 萨姆
- Ew! Sam.

111
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,090
人类的身体千奇百怪
SAM: The human body is insane.

112
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,920
其内部原理 我们只了解到了
And we only understand a small blip of what's actually

113
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,600
很小一部分 所以总是会有
happening inside, so there's always

114
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,900
有新发现
something new to discover.

115
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,570
但除此之外
But, okay, beyond that,

116
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,140
我 我能帮助到别人
I... I help people.

117
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,880
把他们的亲人朋友带回他们身边
I get to bring their loved ones back to them,

118
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,890
哪怕就一小会儿
just for a little while.

119
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,020
我做的事 很重要
What I do is... it's important.

120
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
你只要谈起死人 这股兴奋劲
You just got more excited talking about dead people

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,970
远远超过谈杰西的时候
than you've ever been talking about Jesse.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,810
也许他不是问题所在
Maybe he's not the problem.

123
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,180
我天 你是出什么事了
SAM: Yikes. What happened to you?

124
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,890
雷金纳德·葛洛夫 55岁
Reginald Glover, 55 years old.

125
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,760
死因 头部中枪
Cause of death: gunshot wound to the head.

126
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,830
不开玩笑了
No kidding.

127
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,840
嗨 葛洛夫先生 我是萨姆
Hi, Mr. Glover. I'm Sam.

128
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,980
我今天负责照顾你
I'll be taking care of you today.

129
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,820
这上面说 你家人选择了开放式棺材
Looks like your family wants you to have an open casket,

130
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,120
所以 咱俩得―起把你收抬的齐齐整整
so, I'm gonna need you to work with me

131
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,800
迎接你生命中最重要的一天
so we can make you look presentable for your big day.

132
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,300
我看到你有六个孩子 真不错
I see you had six kids. Nice.

133
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,010
他们给你选择了红木棺材
Looks like they got you the mahogany casket.

134
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,050
这是我们最贵的一款
That's our most expensive one.

135
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
你―定是个好爸爸
You must've been a good dad.

136
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,160
现在
And now...

137
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,300
我天啊 你好 抱歉
Uh, whoa. Hi. Um, sorry.

138
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,940
你来这里干什么 这里谢绝入内
What-what are you doing here? This is a restricted area.

139
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,040
请你马上出去
Can you get out?

140
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,780
我是查理 新来的掘墓移尸官
I'm Charlie, the new grave digger and death removal tech.

141
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,990
我没想故意吓到你
Didn't mean to freak you out.

142
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,930
请问我应该把她放在哪儿
Just tell me where to leave her.

143
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,670
那边就行
Um, just over there.

144
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,840
我这边完事后会去照顾她
I'll-I'll get to her when I wrap up.

145
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,190
嘿 你刚才对死者说了什么
Hey, what did you say down there to the decedent?

146
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,260
就感谢了她一下
I just thanked her.

147
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,930
感谢她什么
Thanked her for what?

148
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,330
是我们的悄悄话
It's kind of private.

149
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,670
抱歉 我刚才冲你发脾气
Well, I'm-I'm sorry I blew up on you.

150
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,670
只不过 你是不能来下面的
It's just, you weren't supposed to be down there.

151
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,580
我知道了 不会有下次了
I hear you. Won't happen again.

152
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,390
我叫萨姆
I'm Sam.

153
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,660
很高兴认识你 萨姆
Nice to meet you, Sam.

154
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,040
所以你这身打扮又是西装又是帽子
So, um, what's up with the... the suit, the hat,

155
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,040
开一辆如此拉风的车
-pimped-out ride?

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,350
大多数移尸官不会
Most, um, body removal techs don't

157
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,220
搞得这么浮夸和隆重
roll up with all that pomp and circumstance.

158
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,660
我觉得每个人都值得被体面的送走
I think all of us deserve to be sent off in style.

159
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,130
你想啊 谁愿意坐在起亚里迎接来世呢
I mean, who wants to ride into the afterlife in a Kia Sorento?

160
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,200
有道理
Fair enough.

161
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,850
我感谢逝者允许
I thanked the decedent for allowing me

162
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,620
我护送她来见你
to escort her to you.

163
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,230
你是认真的吗
Seriously?

164
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,040
加入某人的死亡之旅是一种荣誉
It's an honor to be a part of someone's death journey.

165
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,380
在古埃及 只有专门的牧师
You know, in ancient Egypt, only specialized priests,

166
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,320
被神亲手选中的人 才有资格处理逝者
those handpicked by the gods, were trusted to handle the dead.

167
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,790
他们会花70天将尸体荣装端整
They'd spend up to 70 days on one body,

168
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,290
送他进入来世
getting it ready for the afterlife.

169
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,360
这一点我确实有耳闻
I did know that.

170
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640



171
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,460



172
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,030
你看起来真美
You look incredible.

173
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,040
这是要干嘛
What's all this?

174
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,410
只是想为我爱的人盛装打扮
Just wanted to look nice for my guy.

175
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,180



176
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,780
我在想 或许我们可以
Thought maybe we could go...

177
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,290
出去吃晚餐
out to dinner?

178
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,420



179
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,030
我更想呆家里
I think I'd rather stay in.

180
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,100



181
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,840
所以 你相信死后的世界吗
So, you believe in the afterlife?

182
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,980
不我认为印度教有其道理
No. I think the Hindus have it right.

183
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,780
转世轮回
Reincarnation, samsara.

184
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,350
如果你能转世再生
You come back as any living thing,

185
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,090
你想做个什么
what would you come back as?

186
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,530
我不想再有来生了
I wouldn't want to come back.

187
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,760
我相信人就活―辈子 一锤定音
Um, I'm Team One Life, one and done.

188
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,030
是吗
-Oh. -Mm-hmm.

189
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,340
所以你会按照西藏的习俗
So you'd go out like the Tibetans?

190
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,210
把尸体肢解 洒落在山上
Chop up your body, scatter the pieces

191
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,280
供奉秃鹰
on the mountain for the vultures.

192
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,350
然后 尘归尘 土归土 回到大自然
You'd just return to the earth and all that jazz?

193
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,190
天葬感觉又繁琐又可怕
A sky burial seems unnecessarily gruesome.

194
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,830
不过我可以接受亚马逊人的做法
But, uh, I could get down with how the Amazons do it.

195
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,830
火葬
Cremation,

196
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,940
然后把骨灰拌到汤里 喂给整个部落
then stirring your ashes into soup for the whole tribe.

197
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,270
这也是一种回馈社区的方式
Plus, you'd be giving back to the community.

198
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,520
1500年前的中国 一个女人将自己活埋
CHARLIE: 1,500 years ago in China, a woman buried herself

199
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,820
为他丈夫殉葬 以求生生世世在一起
alive with her dead husband so they could achieve immortality.

200
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,260
这就有点狗血了
That's a bit dramatic.

201
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,360
这才是真爱
That's true love.

202
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,140
纳尔逊勋爵的尸体
SAM: Lord Nelson's body

203
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,370
被泡在一桶白兰地里运回家
was shipped home in a cask of brandy.

204
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,410
在航行中 水手们还偷喝了—小口
The sailors even stole sips along the voyage.

205
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,250
你会偷喝吗
Would you steal a sip?

206
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,090



207
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,530
当然 为什么不呢
Sure. Why not?

208
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,000
实践出真知
Can't learn anything if you don't try everything.

209
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,240
我本身已经挺爱冒险了 不过
I'm pretty adventurous, but, um,

210
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,270
但对尸体泡酒还是接受不了
think I'd draw the line at Dead Nelson juice.

211
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,280
你吃过最冒险的东西是什么
What's the most adventurous thing you've ever eaten?

212
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,410



213
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,020
好久都没这种尝试了
It's been a minute. Um...

214
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,500
我男友不太喜欢尝试新事物
My boyfriend doesn't really like to try new things,

215
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,870
所以我们一般吃得没什么新意
uh, so we pretty much just stick to the basics.

216
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,240
他不喜欢 不代表
Well, just 'cause he doesn't like something doesn't mean

217
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,180
你不能体验啊
you can't experience it.

218
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,220
杰西觉得墨西哥烤牛就挺有异域风情的了
Jesse thinks carne asada is exotic.

219
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,490
服了
Oh, my God.

220
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,000
–我得把你从 -嗯
-I'm gonna have to save you from, your, uh... -Hmm.

221
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,370
悲惨生活中拯救出来
your sad existence.

222
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,200
-我去 -用墨西哥辣椒薯片来拯救你
-Oh, my... -Jalape帽o chips to the rescue!

223
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,610
解放自我吧
Free yourself!

224
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,510
-开拓视野 -别闹了
-Expand your horizons! -Stop!

225
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,890
这个人有不少亲朋好友啊
This guy had a lot of people who loved him.

226
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,060
你家人会为你大办特办吗
Would your family do a whole dog and pony show for you?

227
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,330
不会
Uh... no.

228
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,970
他们能理解你对死亡的痴迷吗
They on board with your whole obsession with death?

229
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,550
希望能吧
I hope so.

230
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,080
他们都去世了
They're all dead.

231
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,060
-对不起 –没关系
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.

232
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,630
我挺喜欢聊起他们的
I like talking about them.

233
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,580
我爸 他是
My Dad-- he was, um...

234
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,120
他是个很棒的人
he was such a stud.

235
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,490
他带我们去锡安
He'd taken us to Zion

236
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,630
就因为他喜欢那些又大又笨重的石头
cause he liked these big, stupid rocks.

237
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,340
我妈可讨厌户外活动了 她很怕热
My mom hated the outdoors. She couldn't stand the heat,

238
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,440
讨厌虫子 但她爱我爸
the bugs, but she loved my dad.

239
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,180
萨迪就是爸爸的小棉袄
Sadie was a total Daddy's girl.

240
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,280
他去哪儿她都会跟上
She'd follow him anywhere.

241
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,650
查理
Charlie?

242
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,190
当时老爸正要讲个笑话
Dad was telling this dumb joke.

243
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,430
我要给你讲个笑话 准备好了没 小伙儿
I got a joke for you. You ready, bud?

244
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,930
他的笑话超老套的
CHARLIE: His jokes were so corny.

245
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,500
但那个笑话把我逗到了 是说
This one got me. Something about a...

246
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,270
一只猴子和一只鬣狗
a monkey and a hyena.

247
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,540
黑猩猩
Chimpanzee.

248
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,260
某种意义上来说 也算是恩赐
In a way, it was a blessing.

249
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,570
我没 没明白
I don't... I don't understand.

250
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,340
与死神擦肩而过
Having such a close brush with death

251
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,340
能看清楚很多事
brought everything into clear focus.

252
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,480
我看到生命的珍贵
I saw how precious life is.

253
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,360
作为活下来的人有责任
And how we as the living owe it to the dead

254
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,190
照顾逝者
to take care of them.

255
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,330
勇敢地生活
And to live boldly.

256
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,510
我完全理解你的感受
I know exactly how you feel.

257
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,050
也有个醉驾司机夺走了你全家的性命吗
Did some drunk driver take out your entire family

258
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,220
还是一场大火
as well in a blaze of glory?

259
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,210
创伤它...
Trauma is, uh...

260
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,620
是很复杂的
It's complicated.

261
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,730
它
It, um...

262
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,250
会影响你的心绪
It fucks with your... brain.

263
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,360
嘿 咱不是在聊我过世的家人么
Hey, I-I thought we were talking about my dead family.

264
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,670
我不会谈论我的家人 从没有过
I don't talk about mine, ever.

265
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,510
没跟杰西聊过 也没跟
Not with Jesse, not with, uh...

266
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,650
任何人聊起过
well, anyone.

267
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,420
但现在 我
But right now, I, um...

268
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,400
我想聊聊
I want to.

269
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,590



270
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,690
-嘿 -嘿 你在哪儿呢
-Hey. -Hey, where are you?

271
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,600
我尽量拖了 我爸妈都饿了
I've been stalling, my parents are getting hungry.

272
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,700
草 对不起
Shit. No. Uh, um, I'm sorry.

273
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,110
我忘干净了 我们
No. I totally spaced. We...

274
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,250
我们在准备葬礼
We're prepping for a service.

275
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,320
我现在就走 好吧
Um... I'm leaving now, okay?

276
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,720
我 十分钟后到家
I'll be... I'll be home in ten.

277
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,030
好吧 过会儿见
All right, see you soon.

278
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,170
嘿 我 我得走了
Hey, I... I got to go.

279
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,240
杰西的父母刚从辛辛那提飞过来
Um, Jesse's parents just flew in from Cincinnati.

280
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,710
-我忘干净这事儿了-没事

没事的 怎么了
-It's okay. What is it?

296
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,380
你怎么了
What is it?

297
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
你总是囤一盒这种麦片
Uh, you always got a box of these stashed,

298
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,950
所以我以为这样会很浪漫
so I thought it'd be romantic.

299
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,390



300
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,460

- 然后呢-她被杀了

305
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,750
一个男人闯进来猛砸她的头
A man broke in and bashed her head

306
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,430
厨房里到处都是血
and there was blood all over the kitchen, and...

307
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,970
-她最喜欢的就是这个了 -没关系
-these were her favorite. -It's all right. It's all right.

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,240
我总会留一盒

能让我觉得离她很近

我完全搞砸了
I'm-I'm completely messed up.

312
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,460
你不会想娶我的
You don't-you don't want to marry me.

313
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,600
-我当然想娶你了 -你人真的太好了
-Of course I want to marry you. -Oh, well, you're so sweet, and

314
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,340
你该跟个很好 很善良 正常的女生在一起
you d-you deserve a nice, a nice, normal girl.

315
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,270
-我不配 -不不不不
-I'm not that person. -No, no, no, no, no.

唯— —个明白
The only one who understood what it was like

329
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,580
在黑暗的深渊中行走
to walk around with this...

330
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,660
是什么感觉的人
...this pit of darkness inside.

331
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,910
你在我身上看到了共鸣
You saw it in me.

332
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,930
而且也没有被吓到
And it didn't scare you.

333
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,670
所有人都会被我吓到
I scare everyone.

334

包括我自己
Even myself.

335

你让我觉得我不再孤单
You made me feel like I wasn't alone anymore.

336
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,420

我一个人太久了
I've been alone for so long.

338

-What the fuck was that, some sort of sick prank? -No.

347

本不该到那种地步的
It was never supposed to go that far.

348
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,040
我知道尸体该什么样
I know what a dead body looks like.

349
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,780
你他妈都不喘气了

这年头网上什么药都能找着

我都看见尸检疤痕了

354
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,260
别回嘴 好吗
Just shut the fuck up, okay?

355
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,200
我只是想帮你
I was trying to help you.

356
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,350
你他妈疯了
You're fucking deranged.

我和你都正常不起来

我们就是这种人
This is who we are.

369
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,850
我刚鬼迷心窍了好吧 你错了

00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,160
我只想过平淡 正常的生活
I just want a boring, regular life.

422
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,530
你向来对平淡正常的生活嗤之以鼻
You never gave a shit about a boring, regular life.

423
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,410
大家齐聚一堂 参加这位男士
OFFICIANT: We are gathered here today to join this man

424
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,380
以及这位女士的神圣婚礼
and this woman in holy matrimony.

425
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,150
杰西和萨曼莎
Jesse and Samantha

426
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,520
经各自准备好誓言
have prepared their own vows

427
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,490
来表达他们的爱
to express their love.

428
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,530
萨曼莎
Samantha?

429
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,270
谢谢
Thank you.

430
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,810
杰西
Jesse.

431
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,250
从小到大
Growing up, I...

432
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,290
我几乎没有家人
didn't really have a family.

433
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,170
本来觉得无所谓的 我
And that was okay. I...

434
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,370
学会了过没有家人的生活
learned to get through life without one.

435
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,310
但后来我遇到了你
But then I met you.

436
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,080
我只
You are...

437
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,150
需要你
(sniffles) ...all I need.

438
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,020
萨姆
Sam...

439
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,300
我第一次看到你
the first time I saw you...

440
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,330
穿着那件大T恤
in that Garbage T-shirt,

441
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,140
狂灌着时代啤酒时
-throwing back a Stella...

442
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,540
我就想 我要娶这姑娘
I thought, I'm gonna marry that girl.

443
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
你就是我的唯一
You are the only one for me.

444
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,290
多年后
And years from now,

445
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,460
等我们身边围着我们的孩子
when we're surrounded by our kids

446
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,460
和孙辈
and our grandkids,

447
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,600
我们就会跟他们讲今天的事
we'll tell them about this day.

448
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,200
给他们讲
And show them

449
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,210
我们的故事
our story.

450
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,080
这不是仪式的一部分
This wasn't part of the program.

451
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,950
有时候打破常规也挺有意思的
Sometimes it can be fun to go off script.

452
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,570
他们好有爱
They're so cute.

453
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,220
那是萨姆吗
Is that Sam?

454
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,590
那是具尸体吗
POPPY: Is that a dead body?

455
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,200
-那是什么 -杰西 你 你
-What is that? -Jesse, you, uh, you...

456
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,610
-拜托你告诉我那不是你 -杰西 你 你不 你不懂
-Please tell me that's not you. -Jesse, you-you don't, you don't understand...

457
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,610
他永远都不会理解你的 萨姆
He's never gonna understand you, Sam.

458
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,550
看看他都做了什么
Look at what he's done.

459
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,690
-抹杀了你身上的所有特别之处 -他是谁啊
-Killed everything special about you. -Who the fuck is he?

460
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,390
他 我们一起工作过
SAM: He, we-we used to work together...

461
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,360
那是视频里那个人
That's the guy in the video.

462
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,960
所以那不是具尸体吗
So it's not a dead body?

463
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,970
不 不 很明显他没死
No, no, he's not dead, obviously.

464
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,640
你听我说 这只是个有点过分的玩笑
Look, this is, it's a sick joke.

465
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,010
-仅此而已 -嗯 但是你确实以为我死了
-This is all... -Yeah, but you thought I was dead.

466
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,240
我觉得这给了你许可
And I think that gave you permission.

467
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,620
让你能做你真正的自己 去追求
The green light to be who you really are, to want what you

468
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,420
-你真正想要的东西 和我在一起 -他 他是出现幻觉了
-really want, to be with me. -He's-he's delusional.

469
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,490
都录下来了 萨姆
There's a tape, Sam!

470
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,600
你趴在一具尸体上
That's you climbing on top of a corpse.

471
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,670
不管是死人还是活人 你都是在上别人
Dead or not, that's you fucking another guy.

472
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,510
-你是谁 -听着
-Who are you? - Look,

473
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,980
我是被骗了 这整件事 这
I-I was tricked. This whole thing, it's a cr--

474
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,150
-这就是个天大的误会 -去你的 萨姆
-it's a crazy misunderstanding. -Fuck you, Sam.

475
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,190
杰西
-Jesse!

476
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,990
杰西 对不起
Jesse, I'm sorry!

477
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,400
杰西停下 杰西
Jesse, stop. Jesse!

478
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,670
–萨姆 萨姆 萨姆 停下 快停下 -你放手 什么
-Sam, Sam, Sam! Stop, stop! -Let fucking go of me! What?

479
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
-你还拍了视频是吗 -这就是真正
-You fucking filmed us? -That is what it looks like

480
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,510
活着的样子
to really be alive.

481
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,650
只有这样我才能救你
This was the only way I could save you.

482
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,690
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

483
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,130
我知道你也爱我
And I know you feel the same.

484
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,670
不 我不爱 我恨死你了
No, I don't. I fucking hate you.

485
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,010
你滚远点
Leave me the hell alone.

486
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,560
看起来你有很丰富的
Well, I can see you have a lot

487
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,300
废物处理经验
of experience in waste disposal.

488
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,370
是的 我处理过
Yes, uh, I've handled every type

489
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,770
你能想到的各种污物
of mess you can imagine.

490
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,550
呕吐物的话 次氯酸钠
Um, for vomit, sodium hypochlorite

491
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,180
和猫砂最有用了
and kitty litter works best.

492
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,660
地板沾上血迹的话 诀窍是
For blood stains on the carpet, the trick is

493
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,060
撒点土豆淀粉
sprinkle a little potato starch actually.

494
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,060
大多数人都不知道怎么清洗马桶
Most people don't even know how to disinfect a toilet.

495
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,740
很简单 用醋就行
Oh, that's easy, vinegar.

496
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,610
很显然你能胜任这份工作
Clearly, you can do the work.

497
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,380
你很擅长清理烂摊了
You know your way around a dirty mess.

498
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,750
抱歉 麻烦
Sorry, excuse me

499
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,690
-等我一下 -嗯
-one minute. -Yeah.

500
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,480
我 很抱歉
I, uh, apologize.

501
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,350
看来我们已经招到人了
It seems like we just filled the position.

502
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,760
要是有机会的活
Oh, um, well, if anything opens up,

503
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,460
我很乐意清理那些没人愿意碰的活儿
I'm happy to take the job nobody wants.

504
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,830
我工作很努力
I'm a very hard worker and, um...

505
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,370
女士
Miss...

506
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,240
我们不能让一个性侵犯
we can't have a sex offender

507
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,740
进客户的家
going into our clients' homes.

508
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,750
不 我 我不是
No, I'm-I'm not, um...

509
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,590
听者 我犯了—个错
Look, I made one mistake.

510
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,620
你这辈子就没犯过错吗
Haven't you ever made a mistake in your life?

511
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,330
我每天都在为此付出代价 求你了
I'm paying for it every single day, please.

512
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,300
我真的急用钱
I-I could really use the cash.

513
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,330
你能给我个机会吗
Can you just give me a chance? Um...

514
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,580
操僵尸的
Zombie fucker!

515
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,640
你毁了我的生活
You ruined my life.

516
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,580
萨姆
Sam...

517
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,690
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

518
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,220
我知道你生我的气
I get you're angry with me.

519
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,460
闭嘴
Shut up.

520
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,600
我的朋友们不理我了
My friends won't talk to me anymore.

521
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,370
没人会雇佣我 因为
No one will hire me 'cause everyone thinks

522
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,910
他们都觉得我是个性侵犯 但是明明
I'm a fucking sex offender, when you're

523
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,780
撒谎的人是你
the one who lied.

524
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,880
是你骗了我
You tricked me.

525
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,420
你夺走了
You took...

526
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
我的一切
everything.

527
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,730
现在你还指望好好过你的生活
And now you get to just keep living your best life?

528
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,210
这可不行
Hmm, it's just not right.

529
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,780
你需要为你做过的事付出代价
You need to pay for what you've done.

530
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,980
萨姆 对不起
Sam, I'm sorry.

531
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,920
求你了
Please.

532
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,390
我们理智地谈谈吧
We can talk rationally.

533
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,530
你不是这样的人
This is not who you are.

534
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,730
我想要答案
-I just want some answers.

535
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,410
我就想知道为什么 我是做了什么伤天害理的事
I just want to know why. What, what did I do to deserve this?

536
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,740
你要这么恨我
Why do you hate me so fucking much?

537
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,680
你这笨蛋 我不恨你
You idiot, I don't hate you!

538
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,780
你被困住了 我只想放你自由
You were trapped! I was trying to set you free!

539
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,290
我不需要帮助
I didn't want any help!

540
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,690
我没求你帮我 我过得挺好的
I never asked for it. I was fine.

541
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,560
不 你不好
No, you weren't!

542
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,770
操了 萨姆
Fuck, Sam.

543
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,910
我的家人死的那天
The day my family died...

544
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,510
我离死亡如此之近 我都能尝到死亡的味道
I was so close to death, I tasted it.

545
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,910
我身上全是他们的血
I had their blood on me.

546
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,280
而我
And I...

547
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,290
真正觉得我活看
felt so alive.

548
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,830
我第一次真正醒来了
I was waking up for the first time.

549
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,900
看清了这世界本来的面目
Seeing the world how it really was.

550
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,430
不要再假装岁月静好了
No more pretending everything's fine

551
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,700
因为这世界根本就不好
when the world's not fucking fine.

552
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,970
我以为如果我能让你
I thought if I could give you that,

553
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,310
与死亡擦肩而过
a close brush with death,

554
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,280
你也会醒来
it would shock you awake.

555
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,720
本来几分钟就好的
It was only supposed to be for a few minutes.

556
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,260
就是想推动你
Just a jump start.

557
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,700
但是你哭了
But then you were crying.

558
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,470
然后开始抚摸我
And you touched me.

559
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,950
而我
And I...

560
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,990
不想让你停下来
I didn't want it to stop.

561
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,430
我不想打破那个瞬间
I didn't want to break the spell.

562
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,000
我对其他人从来没有过
I have never felt that way before

563
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,440
那种感觉
with anyone.

564
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,480
你疯了吧
You're psychotic.

565
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,020
我不需要男人来告诉我
I don't need a man to tell me

566
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,750
我该怎么想该怎么做
what I think or what I really want.

567
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,590
你太自以为是了
That is so goddamn patronizing.

568
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,960
我知道你妈的事
And I know about your mother.

569
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,340
我发誓 你再多说
I swear to God, if you say one fucking...

570
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,070
三天
Three days.

571
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,610
她已经死了三天
She was dead for three days

572
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,620
别人才找到你
before they found you.

573
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,620
三天里 你喝了你死去母亲的母乳
For three days, you drank your dead mother's milk.

574
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,630
你闭嘴
Shut the fuck up.

575
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,730
你真恶心
You're disgusting.

576
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,600
你也很恶心
You're disgusting.

577
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,510
但很美
And beautiful.

578
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,510
又破碎
And fucked up.

579
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,720
又美好
And amazing.

580
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,620
你什么样子都有
You are all those things, all at the same time.

581
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,020
所以这就是为什么我爱你
And that's why I love you.

582
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,760
我爱你 萨姆
I love you, Sam.

583
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,330
你不用再躲藏了
You don't have to hide anymore.

584
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,780
让我看到真正的你 告诉我
Let the real you out, and tell me,

585
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,020
第―次品尝死亡是什么感觉
what did it feel like, to taste death for the first time?

586
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,610
感觉像爱
It felt like love.

587
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,050
一开始我以为她
At first, I thought she had just...

588
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,120
只是撞到了头
bumped her head.

589
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,460
然后睡着了
And she was sleeping.

590
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,670
我梳了她的头发
I brushed her hair.

591
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,380
我
I...

592
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,450
我给她吃麦片
I fed her cereal.

593
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,660
就我和妈妈两个人
Just Mama and me.

594
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,680
那是我最后一次有安全感
It was the last time I ever felt safe.

595
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,420
怪不得我这么奇怪 操
No wonder I'm so screwed up, fuck.

596
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,530
然后我
And I...

597
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,400
我以为我再也不会有那种感觉了
I thought I would never feel like that again.

598
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,540
直到那天晚上
Until that night.

599
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,820
和你在一起
Until I was with you.

600
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,990
变态吧
How fucked up is that?

601
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,060
我明白
I get it.

602
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,090
我理解你
I get you.

603
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,500
我永远不会评判你
I will never judge you.

604
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,610
你应该让我继续浑浑噩噩下去的
You should've just let me keep sleepwalking.

605
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,980
我都忘了我有多破碎
I had forgotten I was broken.

606
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,830
但是现在我看出来了
But now I see.

607
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,700
我真正想要的是同时
I think what I really want is to be dead

608
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,700
活着并死去
and alive at the same time.

609
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,040
这永远不可能
And I can never have that.

610
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,920
我永远拼不好碎掉的碎片
There's no way to put the pieces back together.

611
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,000
我已经没救了
There's no hope for me.

612
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,010
萨姆
Sam.

613
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,220
我们在一起就有希望
There's hope for us.

614
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,630
为了和你在一起
I would do anything...

615
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,030
我什么都愿意做
to be with you.

616
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,000
我愿意死一百万次
I would die a million times

617
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,970
来换和你在一起的一分钟
to be with you for a minute.

618
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,610
一千年
For a thousand years.

619
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,480
永远
Forever.

620
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,930
你是认真的 对吧
You really mean that, don't you?

621
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,800
你很奇怪 我很奇怪
Your weird and my weird,

622
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,900
我们就应该在一起
we belong together.

623
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,840
我们可以过得很快乐
We can be happy.

624
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,520
我们可以过得很快乐吗
We can be happy?

625
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,060
让我给你幸福
Let me make you happy.

626
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,800
嗯
Yeah.

627
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,610
我觉得只有你可以
I think you're the only one that could.

628
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,710
一分钟
For a minute.

629
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,980
一千年
For a thousand years.

630
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,850
永远
Forever.

631
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,800
永远
Forever.
