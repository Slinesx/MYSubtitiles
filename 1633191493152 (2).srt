但通过你和人交谈的方式来看

141
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,080
你能搞定吗 她得跟我走
Have you got this? Cos I need her with me.

142
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,360
这里只剩两个护エ了 逗我呢吧
Well, there's only two of us. Are you kidding?

143
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,320
我们去去就回
We'll be quick.

144
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,360
我的脚疼
My feet hurt.

145
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
这是因为你一整天都在
Oh, that's because you've been walking over

146
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,640
我心上徜祥 朋友
my heart all day, pal.

147
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,800
来我们坐下休息一会
Come on, let's have a sit-down.

148
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,400
你会通过她的脚
You'll know her...

149
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,600
认出她来
.by her foot

150
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,200
最小巧的藤黄色的手
The smallest gamboge hand

151
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,600
连着手指 也是指尖间的所在
Fingers where the toes should be

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
会更多地冒犯沙子
Would more affront the sand.

153
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,160
真美
That's beautiful.

154
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,680
这是他离开的路线
This is his route.

155
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,520
我没法分心找他 你两边都看看
I can't watch for him, you can, both windows.

156
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,080
你还记得他的长相吧
You remember his face, right?

157
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,320
他年纪也不算大 怎么这么严重了
He's a bit young, isn't he, for all this?

158
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,400
这种情况比你想象的要常见
It happens more than you think, you know.

159
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,920
他得阿兹海默症估计有一阵子了
Probably been ill for a while with the Alzheimer's,

160
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,720
但他妈妈一直瞒着他
but his mum was masking it.

161
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,120
总之 她死了 他在后厨放了火
Anyway, she dies and he sets fire to the back kitchen,

162
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,000
-最后半裸地走在街上 -天呐
- ends up walking down the street half naked... - Shit.

163
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,640
警察把他抓住的时候 他一直说
Police pick him up and he's like,

164
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,120
"别碰我 别碰我"
"Don't touch me, don't touch me!"

165
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
-你了解这种情况吧 -不了解
- You know the sort of thing? - No.

166
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,720
经过几次评估
A few evaluations later

167
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
和一两次脑部扫描后 他就住到疗养院了
and a brain scan or two and he moves in with us.

168
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,800
他人不错
He's a lovely fellow...

169
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
但不管怎样他都会乱跑
...but can't keep him still for love nor money.

170
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,080
那里
There.

171
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
他在那儿
There he is.

172
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,400
-在那 -好样的
- There... - Good girl, good girl.

173
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,600
托尼过来伙计
Tony, come on, mate.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,720

175
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640

177
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,400
把你该死的手拿开行吗
Get your fucking hands off me, will ya?!

178
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,920
好了托尼你会像上次那样
Tony, come on. You're going to get me into trouble

179
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,280
让我在警察那难以交代的
with the police again like last time.

180
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,480
一你他妈是谁啊这么跟我讲话-托尼
- Who the fuck are you to talk to me like that? - Tony...

181
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,440
-你现在糊涂了伙计 -想打一架吗
- You're just confused, mate. - Do you want to go?

182
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,120
知这样我是斯蒂夫 -我还以为你会欢迎
- Come on. It's only Steve. - I was expecting a big hello here

183
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,320
但你却这么对我
and this is what you do.

184
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,560
一句半的糖
One and a half sugars.

185
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,520
我要回去找我老妈
I've got to get back to me ma.

186
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,920
她需要我
She needs me.

187
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,800
我不在家的话她会担心
She worries about me when l'm not there.

188
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
为什么 是因为你上学的时候调皮捣蛋吗
Why, were you a naughty boy at school, was you?

189
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,800
有时是的
Sometimes, yeah...

190
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,120
那她确实该担心对吧
she had a right to worry, then, didn't she?

191
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,960
你想去我们家吗
Well, do you want to come back to ours?

192
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,400
我老妈做的炖杂烩全世界最好吃
Me ma makes the best scouse in the world.

193
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,080
我也爱炖杂烩 尤其是配上一大句棕酱
Oh, I love scouse, especially with a load of HP.

194
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,680
你能把她的秘方给我吗
Can you tell me her recipe?

195
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
不行她死也不会给你的
No, she'd rather die.

196
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,040
她去世了 对吧
She is dead, isn't she?

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
我忘了我老妈去世了
I forgot me ma was dead.

198
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,400
托尼我们带你回家
We're going to take you home, Tony.

199
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,480
我要回家
I'm going home...

200
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,040
托尼现在有别人住在那
Somebody else lives there now, Tony.

201
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,480
市议会已经把房子给别人了
The council, they've given that to someone else.

202
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,240
你现在住在我们那
You have a bed in a home with us

203
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,920
晴空疗养院你还记得吗

204
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,640
晴空
Bright Sky.

00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,400

- You all right? - Oh, hey.

217
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,000
还有六份早餐没做 也还没来得及喂饭
So, we've got six breakfasts due, and we're behind on feeds.

218
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
怎么会没按时给他们喂饭
How did we get behind on feeds?

219
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,240
要帮忙备药就返迟了
Needed a hand with the meds order. We're behind.

220
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,160
老年人起迟了我们也迟了
Seniors are behind, we're behind.

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,520
你要不要先换格洛丽亚的垫子
Do you want to make a start on Gloria's pad change?

222
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,000
然后给赫尔克里斯喂早饭

好了该下楼了
OK, time for downstairs.

226
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,200
我知道
I know.

227
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:10,480
我喜欢调皮殿子好吧

228
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,640
有个小男孩叫利亚姆
Now, there's this little boy called Liam,

229
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,040
他半夜下楼
and he goes downstairs in the middle of the night

230
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,680
跟他爸要了一杯水
and he asks his dad for a cup of water...

231
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,960
他们确实会那样做
Oh, they do that.

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,920
他爸爸说"天响利亚姆这是你今晚
And his dad says, "Jesus, Liam, that's the 15th one"

233
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,440
他爸爸说"天呐利亚姆 这是你今晚
And his dad says, "Jesus, Liam, that's the 15th one"

234

要的第15杯水了"
"you've asked for tonight."

235
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,680
小孩不睡觉的时候确实麻烦
Oh, it's difficult when they won't asleep.

236
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,640
他说爸爸我知道这是第15杯水"
00
And he says, "I know it's the 15th, Dad,"

237
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,400
但我的房间还是在着火"
"but me room's still on fire."

238
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,240
这笑话不好笑
It's not a great joke.

239
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,320
你准备好和我下楼了吗

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,360

244
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,640
在吃早饭前要先装上牙齿
I need you to pop your teeth in before we do breakfast.

245
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,080
你不喜欢我这么做
You don't like me doing it.

246
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,440
上次你咬了我 还记得吗
You bit me last time. Do you remember?

247
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,360
来赫尔克吃饭前..。

Come on, Herc, before we...

248
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,400
来赫尔克吃饭前.。

249
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,440
来赫尔克吃饭前..
Come on, Herc, before we...

250
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,960
来赫尔克吃饭前..
000
Come on, Herc, before we...

251
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
真他妈的
Fuck's sake...!

252
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
什么 你在指什么呢
What? What are you pointing at?

253
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,200
什么 我的头发吗
What? Me hair?

254
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,160
头发怎么了
What about it?

255
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,920
我的心就是我的王国
My mind to me a
kingdom is,

256
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,080
在其中我找到诸多欢愉
therein such present joys I find,

257
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,520
世界所能给予的和在此之上滋长的
that it excels all other bliss that Earth affords

258
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,440
都不及此
or grows by kind.

259
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,600
我所求诸多 世人皆有
Through much I want that most do have,

260
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,000
但我的心不允乞求
yet still my mind forbids to crave.

261
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,320
没有王子的气派 没有富人的积蓄
No princely pomp, no wealthy store,

262
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,600
没有获胜的力量
no force to win the victory,

263
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:07,640
RI

264
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,960
没有减轻伤痛的狡黠头脑
no wily wit to salve a sore,

265
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,960
没有模型来勾勒一双爱眼
no shape to feed a loving eye.

266
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,320
我不曾像奴隶一般屈服于此种种
To none of these I yield as thrall.

267
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,720
ints
For why?
{\r译文字幕}为什么

268
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,240
因为一切由我的心提供
My mind doth serve for all.

269
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,600
我时常看到过度饮食者
I see how plenty surfeits oft,

270
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
也看到心急的攀登者很快跌落
and hasty climbers soon do fall.

271
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,480
我看到这些高高在上者
I see those that are aloft,

272
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,720
厄运也会萌荫其上
mischance may threaten most of all.

273
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,760
他们辛辛苦苦劳作战战兢兢坚持
They get with toil, they keep with fear.

274
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,600
我心无法承受此虑
Such cares my mind could never bear.

275
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,240
随遇而安为吾信条
Content I live, this is my stay...

276
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,360
她是英语老师
English teacher.

277

279
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
真好
It's nice.

280
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,880
出于某种原因
And for some reason,

281
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,400
圣诞节很少有人失禁
at Christmas less people shit themselves.

282
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,840
这要感谢圣诞老人-没错

285
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,160
、这首诗真优美波莉

286
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,640
什么我说讲得真优美小波
- What? -I said, that was beautiful, Pol.

287
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,480
有位从兰开夏郡来的年轻淑女
That was a young lady from Lancashire,

288
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,800
她抵挡不住情人的情欲
who succumbed to her lover's desire.

289
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,120
她说"这是罪过但既然进去了
She said, "Oh, this is sin, but now that it's in,

290
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,880
你能再深入一点吗"
can you push it a few inches higher?"

291
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,320
这是我们一起去沙滩时拍的照片

292
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,560

- Take her away, take her away. - It's Joan, it's your girl...

301

她因为过度悲痛丧失了心智
She was out of her mind with grief,

302
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,080
还背负着罪过 天主教的罪过
and guilt, Catholic guilt...

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,560
这很古怪但我只觉得她与罪过共生
It was all weird. But I just think she lived with the guilt.

304
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,160
没有访客吗

305

什么
What?

311
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
很简单的游戏 真的
It's a simple game, really.

312
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,120
发六张牌 三张朝下 三张朝上
You deal three card blind, three cards facing,
++120

313
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
你手里再拿三张牌
and you get three cards in your hand.

314
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,560
游戏的目标是把牌都出了
Right, the aim of the game is to get rid of all your cards.

315
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,400
-明白了吗 -明白

牌最大的获胜

317
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
如果你压不过就从牌堆里拿一张
If you can't go higher, then you pick up from the pile.

318
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,160
只有二是不一样的
Only cards that'll do you different is two

319
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,560
出了二或七 就要从头开始
which means you start again from two or seven.

320
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,000
如果我出七你就得出比它小的
If I play a seven, you have to play lower then.

321
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,200
或者出十
Or a ten,

322
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,600
十就类似魔术卡可以清理所有牌
which is like a magic card, a ten clears the whole pile.

323
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,400
-懂了吗 -这么多规则你怎么记住的
- Capishe? - How do you remember all of that?

324
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,160
没关系玩着玩着就会了
It's all right. Yeah, we'll pick up as we go along.

325
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,200
我从来不热衷于
•..
I never was a big fan of...

326
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,200
M-下想不起来了
It'll come to me.

327
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,400
是圣诞节
Christmas.

328
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,880
你为什么不喜欢圣诞节
Well, why weren't you a fan?

329
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,000
爸爸离开的时候就只剩我和特丽莎阿姨
Well, when my dad left, it was just me and Aunt Trisha.

330
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,920
我们得照顾我妈
We had to look after me mum.

331
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
太难了
That was hard.

332
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,640
有些时候真的是一团糟
Some days it was really messy.

333
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,560
医生给她开了药之后 她就
And then after that doctor gave her her tablets, then...

334
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,120
一直窝在沙发上
she never left the couch.

335
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,680
我记得有一次圣诞爸爸什么都没给我
I remember one Christmas me Dad didn't get me anything.

336
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,200
没有礼物
No presents.

337
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,560
他说“我跟她说过了"
He says, "I told her"

338
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,800
如果她不当个乖孩子 就什么都没有"
"if she weren't a good girl, she weren't going to get shit."

339
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,640
你是吗
And were you?

340
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,160
是乖孩子吗
Was you a good girl?

341
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,800
当时我在PRU 所以
Well, I was in PRU at the time, so...

342
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,360
PRU是小学生转送部
Oh, it's a pupil referral unit.

343
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,160
基本上没有学校要的孩子才会去那里
It's...it's basically where they put kids no school wants.

344
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,880
别笑那时候我オ12岁
No! But I was 12!

345
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,840
你明自我的意思吗我那时
Do you know what I mean? I was...

346
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,240
认为所有12岁的孩子都应该有礼物不是
I think all 12-year-olds should get presents. Don't you?

347
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
是是吧最糟糕的是
- Yeah.... - Yeah, well, the worst thing

348
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,480
我妈还没有异议
was me mum went along with it.

349
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,960
她也一样坏
She's just as bad.

350
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
所以你是个十足的坏女孩
So you were a proper bad girl, then?

351
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,800
"十足的坏女孩"
"Proper bad girl."

352
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,120
我确实搞了些破坏
I did some damage.

353
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,320
小学的时候
Primary school,

354
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,960
我弄丢了弹弹球老师也找不到
I'd lost me bouncy ball, and the teacher couldn't find it,

355
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,160
所以我就弄碎了教室里所有的灯
so I smashed every single light in the classroom

356
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,040
被停了两周课

359
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,560
因为我比她先长出胸

360
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,480
我就痛打了她一顿

没错我因此转学了
Yeah. Got moved schools for that.

362
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,920

368
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,920
-不过我没拿到证书 -我也没拿到

第三所学校找到了我

370
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,640
我记得我偷了看门人的钥匙

371
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,800
T让我的那些朋友进去

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,320
雷丁镇的皇家巴克希尔医院声称
The Royal Berkshire Hospital, in Reading,

416
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
她本身患有基础疾病
said she had underlying health issues.

417
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,160
英国的感染人数
The number of people infected in the UK

418
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,640
又升至116人
has jumped again to 116...

419
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,640
羊儿的秘密是它们会轻易爱上人类
Now, the secret with sheep is that they love easily,

420
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,600
一只羊爱上你的方法之一就是给它好吃
and a way to make a sheep love you is to feed it.

421
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,000
这边我的同事苏珊
So, my colleague there, Susan,

422
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,920
她会给你们分发饲料
she's coming round with some feed to give you.

423
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
以愿意喂羊的人准备好得到羊羊的爱!
So those of you who are willing, get ready to be loved.

424
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,120
我看你挺乐意的兄弟
I can see you are, fella.

425
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,920
你跟它们一样在吃东西呢
You're chomping at the bit like these are, aren't you?

426
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,640
好了
All right.

427
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,400
准备好 三 二 -
Get ready. Three, two, one.

428
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,480
准备好 三 二
Get ready. Three, two, one.

429
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,920
准备好三二一
Get ready. Three, two, one.

430
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,200
去吧传播点爱对了直接过去
Go on! Spread some love. That's it, straight in there.

431
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,800
去吧传播点爱对了 直接过去
Go on! Spread some love. That's it, straight in there.

432
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,800
朋友们那边那只大的叫晃晃
That big one there, love, is Wonky.

433
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,760
别亲它 它会嫌弃你的
Don't kiss him. He knows where you've been.

434
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,840
我能感受到它的心跳
I can feel her heart.

435
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,880
是吗
Can you?

436
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,400
很平静
Very calming.

437
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,480
你愿意的话可以给它念首诗
You can tell her a poem, if you like.

438
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,640
不了 这样就很好
No, this is nice as it is.

439
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,880
挠挠它的下巴它可喜欢了跟我一一样
Tickle him under his chin, he loves that, like me.

440
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,400
医院给我们来了通知
We've had word from the hospital,

441
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,280
我们要再接收几个老人
we're going to be taking on a few more residents.

442
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
多少 -八个
- How many? - Eight.

443
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,840
都是因为新冠病毒
It's the virus thing.

444
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,240
他们就是要给医院腾出空来
They just need, you know, to make space,

445
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,920
摆脱掉一些长期住户
get rid of a few long termers.

446
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,800
-这样安全吗他们是医生亲爱的
- Well, is it safe, like? - They're doctors, love.

447
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
怎么你以为我不看新闻吗 我懂
What, and you think I don't watch the news? I know.

448
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,200
这也是我们在尽一份力
This is us doing our bit.

449
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,120
那些老人中大多数几年前就该走了
Most of them should have been out years ago,

450
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,640
他们只是在占用床位
they're just blocking up beds.

451
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,960
我们在发挥作用
We're being useful.

452
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,640
一这是好事 好
- It's good... - OK.

453
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,400
这位是斯坦他85岁了
This is Stan, he's 85 years old.

454
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,440
你好斯坦
Hiya, Stan.

455
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,960
你的口罩呢
Where's your mask?

456
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,160
我不知道需要戴口罩
Uh, I didn't knew we needed to wear them.

457
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,840
-你的主管是谁-我是主管
- Who's your manager? - I'm the manager.

458
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,600
除非接触感染者 否则不用口罩
No masks unless you're around the infection,

459
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,920
他们是这样通知我们的
that's what we were told.

460
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,680
他检测过了对吧 没有感染
He's been tested, right? He's all clear?

461
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,080
那不是我该管的事 送他进去吧
It's above my station, that. Shall we get him in?

462
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,920
我今天还要再送五个人
I've got five others to deliver today.

463
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,760
我们送你去舒服点的地方吧 斯坦
Yeah, let's get you somewhere comfortable, shall we, Stan?

464
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,720
了我要跟你们所有人讲讲新冠相关的规
Right, I need to talk to you all about Covid-19 protocols.

465
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,800
我们需要更多个人防护装备
We need more PPE....

466
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
咱们先别说话这么沖好吧
Let's not start out all aggressively, shall we?

467
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,760
我们这个有一点那个有一点
We've got a box of this and a box of that

468
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,880
但主要还是什么都缺
but mostly we've got a box of eff all.

469
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
我在努力
Look, I am trying.

470
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,760
我昨天开车去了每个诊所
I drove around every bloody chemist yesterday,

471
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,560
默西塞德郡中心的每家诊所都去了
every one in the best part of Merseyside.

472
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,920
买不到口罩
I couldn't get masks,

473
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,000
买不到酒精棉片什么都没有
I couldn't get alcohol wipes, couldn't get nothing.

474
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,760
公共卫生局也压根不管
And PHE don't give a shit....

475
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,440
对都是定量配给就这么简单
No, it's rationing, pure and simple.

476
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,480
他们想保护NHS至于疗养院
They want to protect the NHS and care homes can just

477
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:15,960
可以自生自灭
go to hell.

478
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,080
指导意见说只有在距离感染者两米内时
The guidance is face masks should only be worn

479
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,240
才需要戴口罩
when within two metres of the infected

480
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,680
而我们这还没有感染者
and we don't have any infected yet so

481
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,640
所以也不用口罩 好吗
we don't need to wear them, OK?

482
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,400
至于清洁若有疑虑
Cleaning - when in doubt,

483
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,520
就用手边任何消毒剂进行消毒
scrub with every disinfectant you can find.

484
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,320
从现在起住户都將
And residents are to be fed

485
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
在自己房间单独用餐
in their rooms exclusively from now on.

486
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,360
我们哪有时间一个个喂饭
Where are we supposed to find time for that?

487
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,320
首要任务是将住户们都隔离开
The priority has to be keeping the residents apart,

488
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,520
所以我们院内
so we have to do a lockdown

489
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,160
必须封闭管理 -但我们在房间之间走动叫
- inside the home. - But we carry it between them.

490
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,480
那我们就要小心
Then we have to be dead careful not

491
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,520
别将病毒四处传播
to carry it between them.

492
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,720
只要发现病例就隔离护理好吗
As soon as we know there's a case, barrier nursing, OK?

493
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,680
勤洗手
Washing hands, erm...

494
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,000
过生日也分开过
Happy Birthday twice,

495
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,520
唱歌的时候也分两段唱
or two verses of Ferry Cross The Mersey.

496
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,760
新口罩新防护围裙呢做不到是吧
New masks, new aprons? Oh, no, we can't do that, can we?

497
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,560
而且禁止探视-什么
- And I'm banning visits. - What?

498
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,160
搞清情况再说
Just till we know.

499
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,040
等下没有这方面要求啊
Hold on, there's no advice on that.

500
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,240
没错这是我要求的
No, that's me.

501
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,880
为了这里每个人的安全我决定这样
I'm saying it's happening, for the sake of everyone here.

502
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,640
比尔怎么办
What about Bill?

503
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,760
他睡在休息室里我拿他怎么办
He sleeps in the lounge. What am I supposed to do with it

504
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,720
让他去自己房间睡一次啊
Tell him to sleep in his own bloody bed for once.

505
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,920
最后一件事
One last thing,

506
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,640
洗衣房说他们现在只能洗
the laundry service have said that they can only do half

507
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,560
之前一半的衣服所以拜托大家
of what they did before so can we please

508
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,480
尽量把被单都用得久一点
try and keep the sheets on the beds a little bit longer.

509
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,000
斯蒂夫得了吧
Oh, Steve, come on.

510
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,320
如果人们生病了就需要新床单
If people are sick they need new sheets.

511
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,040
他们难道不明自吗
Do they not know that?

512
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,880
因为新冠政策 洗衣房的员工也要保持
It's Covid protocol. It's there to keep their staff apart. It's.

513
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,160
我不知道我也不知道真烦人
I don't know. It's...I don't know. It's annoying.

514
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,720
这些都很频
It's...It's all just annoying.

515
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:28,840
这響都很频
It's...It's all just annoying.

516
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,600
我们从中开始实行好吗
From midday we implement, O?

517
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,480
-我去给你们找防护装备-好
- And I will find you your PPE. - Yeah

518
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,480
一共有92家疗养院
There have been 92 care homes

519
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,480
都爆发了疫情
where an outbreak has been detected.

520
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,440
我们下一步的目标是增加
One of the things we want to do is to extend the amount

521
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,120
疗养院人群的检测数量以及检测能力
of testing of people in care homes and the ability to test..

522
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
你去哪了
Where have you been?

523
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,000
出去了 怎么 要告发我吗
Out. Why? Looking to grass me up are you?

524
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,440
你不能出去
You're not supposed to be going out.

525
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,960
收起你这些废话吧 你不也出去工作:
You can cut the holier than thou crap. You're going to wol

526
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,200
那是因为我应该去工作 我的工作需要
I'm supposed to be in work. I'm needed in work.

527
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,880
是是他们都被传染了 你就会把病毒带[
Yeah, and they've all got it, and you're bringing it here,

528
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,280
-有什么区别吗 -因为
so what's the problem? - Because your

529
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,880
你那些狐朋狗友会传染给你
divvy mates could infect you,

530
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,720
你就会传染给我我就有可能传染给住
which could infect me, which could then infect my resident

531
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,080
别放屁了
It's such shit.

532
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,920
我还年轻 我得让我的生命有意义
I'm young. I need to live my life - do something with it.

533
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,400
可不是嘛你在做让生命有意义的事作
Yeah, you're really doing something with your life, aren't yo

534
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,680
好了好了好了
Hey, hey, hey.

535
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,800
你听起来好像你爸爸
You sound like your dad.

536
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,000
她先嚷嚷的 说我不能出门
It's her, saying Il can't go out.

537
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,600
如果他传染给我 我就会传给老人们
If he infects me and then linfect them.

538
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,800
总会有办法解决的 不是吗
Well, there's a solution to that, isn't there?

539
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,520
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

540
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,800
之前没有你的薪水我们也过得好好的
We've coped without your wage before,

541
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,960
现在也可以
we can cope again.

542
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,280
别这样 我喜欢这份工作妈妈
- Come on now... -I like it, Mum.

543
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,640
实际上我很擅长这份工作
Actually, I'm good at it.

544
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,800
*悄然辞行*

545

*悄然辞行*

这叫俯卧可以可以让呼吸畅通点
It's called proning, and it may ease...it may ease your pipe

现在是我该说谢谢了吗
Is this the point where I say thank you?

963
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,080
感觉好像现在是这个时机
It feels like this should be that point.

964
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,960
所以现在有什么要做的吗
So, what needs doing?

965
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,880
我们的药物供应眼不上
We're behind on meds.

966
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,720
那么告诉我去曼德勒[缅甸的城市]的路
Then show me the way to Mandalay.

967
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,200
现在我回来管事了
I've come to take charge now.

968
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,480
我之前想了很多
Been doing a lot of thinking.

969
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,000
-我们需要轮流使用外部空间-好主意
- We need a rotation on the use of outside space.... - Good idea.

970
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,640
还有内部空间住户不能总是整天待在屋里
And inside. They can't be in their rooms all day....

971
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,600
好主意我们需要安排访客制度
1211
- Good idea. - We need the system for visits.

972
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,240
只需要在停车场布置一下我们就能..
121251
OOO
I think with some simple rigging in the car park, we'll be...

973
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,400
行小聪明别把我的活都抢了好吗
All right, bright spark, let me get my feet under the table, will you?

974
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,120
877

975
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,520
CAME

976
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,160
我来给你换床具
I've come to change your bedding.

977
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,160
然后我们来吃早饭好吗
And then let's get you some breakfast, shall we?

978
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,600
托尼吃了什么药
What's Tony on?

979
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,960
一你什么意思你让托尼吃了什么药
- What do you mean? - What the fuck have you put Tony on?

980
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,600
-处方是 -好但是为什么
- It's prescribed.... - Yeah, but why?

981
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,200
莎拉 我知道你对这一切还不太熟悉
Sarah, I know you're still quite new to this

982
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,120
而且之前你的工作很艰难
and you've had a very hard time...

983
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,000
放屁如果你要给他下药那就滚回家去
No, fuck off back home if you're just going to drug him!

984
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,840
他又想逃走
He tried to escape again.

985
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,960
冶终存在潜逃风险所以我们和麦卡维医生谈了
He's a constant flight risk, so we spoke with Dr McCavitt

986
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,760
托尼重新制定了一份治疗计划我们只需要看着
- and devised a new patient plan for Tony.... - We just need to watch him.

987
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,360
我们以前都是看着他就好
We've always watched him before.

988
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,120
他脑子还清醒着斯蒂夫
brain is still good, Steve.

989
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,560
我们不能这么做我以前见过你这种情况
- Can't be doing this. - I've seen this before.

990
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,440
他们不是病人他们是住户
They're not patients, they are residents.

991
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,560
而且大多数人都快死了
And they're mostly fucking dead.

992
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,120
当他需要用脑时却在让他脑子变園
You are slowing him down when he needs his wits about him.

993
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,200
他脑子很正常斯蒂夫
He's got a good head on him, Steve.

994
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,440
他脑子很正常斯蒂失
He's got a good head on him, Steve.

995
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,320
你别管他就好了
You just leave him be.

996
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,560
你干这一行才干了多久五个月
You've been doing this, what, five months.

997
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,640
我已经在这一行坚持了很公了
I've been pushing this rock up a hill for a little bit longer,

998
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,760
所以注意你的态度等你.
so watch out till you...

999
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:21,840
所以注意你的态度等你.。
so watch out till you...

1000
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,640
求你了别喂他吃药了多说无益
Please, take him off the drugs, no more needs to be said.

1001
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,200
为什么他对你这么重要
Why does he matter so much to you, eh?

1002
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,880
因为他是个好人
Because he is a good man.

1003
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,120
好人真的太少了
Which is really fucking rare.

1004
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,880
我就是坏人了是吗
And I'm a bad man, am l?

1005
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,000
我相信你很在乎他们斯蒂夫
I believe you care about them, Steve.

1006
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,160
真的
I really do.

1007
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:42,480
真的
I really do.

1008
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:42,560
真的
T really do.

1009
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,320
这不是你的错
And none of this is your fault.

1010
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,240
这不是你的错
And none of this is your fault.

1011
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,640
但你执行了你就跟他们那些人一样
But you do this, and you are just like the rest of them.

1012
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,320
一你太累了-对确实
- You're exhausted. - Yeah, I am, actually.

1013
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,880
疗养院一两周没你也能顶得住所以回家去吧
And the home can cope without you for a week or two, so go home,

1014
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,200
疗养院一两周没你也能顶得住所以回家去吧
And the home can cope without you for a week or two, so go home,

1015
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:00,840
好好休息
have a rest,

1016
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,920
-好好想想这是不是你想要的结果要炒了我吗
- have a good think about whether this is what you want. - Sacking me?

1017
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,280
不是我只是让你知道
No, I'm simply letting you know

1018
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:09,560
我们收入也少了-收入减少是因为他们死了斯蒂
- we have reduced income. - They are reduced cos they died, Steve.

1019
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,320
我们收入也少了收入减少是因为他们死了斯蒂:
we have reduced income. - They are reduced cos they died, Steve.

1020
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:11,920
对我就是要让这地方
Yeah, and I'm trying to keep this fucking place

1021
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,040
等你好好考虑一下现在的处境
Finish your shift and then give me a call

1022
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,880
改变想法后再给我打电话好吗
when you had a little bit of think about the situation, will you?

1023
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,120
-好把你口罩戴上
IN ITE
- Yeah.... - Put your mask back on.

1024
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,320
只有我一个人 保罗
Only me, Paul.

1025
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,360
我不会把你留在这里的
I'm not leaving you in here.

1026
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,640
在这里等着托尼
Wait there, Tony.

1027
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,280
你确定我在学校什么也没学到吗
Are you sure I didn't learn anything in school, eh?

1028
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,480
你能听到鸟叫吗能
·Can you hear the birds? - Yeah.

1029
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,280
-*高*-不玩了 太逊了
- *High..*. - No, it's crap.

1030
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,800
这首歌太逊了 小美女 我想到首更好听的
It's crap, you soft tomato. I've got a better one.

1031
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,480
那可不是首拍手歌
That's not a clap routine!

1032
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,080
*当红军行军时*
*Oh, when the Reds go marching in!*

1033
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,280
*我想加入他们的行列*
*I want to be in their number*

1034
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,640
*当红军行军时*
*Oh, when the Reds go marching in*

1035
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,680
一*行军时* -小点声
- *Go marching in...* - Shush!

1036
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,600
-小点声 -*当红军行军时*
- Shush! - *When the Reds go marching in...*

1037
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,760
那里就是你的天堂
There's your paradise.

1038
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,880
也不是很差劲 对吧
It's not so bad, is it?

1039
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,080
你只是指今天对吧
You only asked today.

1040
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,080
没人喜欢全知全能的人
No-one likes a know-it-all, you know?

1041
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,000
小托
Tone!

1042
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,280
我得回我妈妈家了
I've got to get back to me ma.

1043
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,680
不那是我妈妈听着她需要我
No, it's me ma. Look, she needs me.

1044
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,880
我不在家她会担心我的
She worries about me when l'm not there.

1045
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,960
你有点迷路了走吧 她家在这边
Hey, you're a little bit lost. Come on now. She's this way.

1046
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,120
你那样洗会让我的衣服掉色的
You'll make the colour run on me top like that.

1047
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,080
这样一来你就不会像大象一样臭了
That will stop you smelling like an elephant.

1048
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,320
下午好欢迎来到唐宁街
Good afternoon and welcome to Downing Street

1049
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
参加每日新冠疫情简报会
for the daily coronavirus briefing.

1050
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,080
我想告诉各位我们在这场危机中
I want to tell you what we've been doing

1051
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,880
致力于保护疗养院住户的举措
to protect people in care homes throughout the crisis.

1052
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,440
很明显从一开始 
Right from the start it's been clear

1053
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:52,360
这种可怕的病毒对老年人的影响最大
that this horrible virus affects older people most.

1054
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,120
因此 从一开始我们就试着
So, right from the start we've tried

1055
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,840
在疗养院周围建立保护圈
to throw a protective ring around our care homes.

1056
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:01,080
我们于二月发布了第一条通告
We set out our first advice in February

1057
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,920
随着病毒的延我们始终都在加强保护
and as the virus grew, we strengthened it throughout.

1058
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,720
我们确保疗养院有所需的资源
We made sure that care homes have the resources they need

1059
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,680
来控制疫情的蔓延
to control the spread of infection.

1060
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,200
社会关怀是一个基层问题..
Social care is a devolved matter...

1061
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,600
我以前总说你不会做黄油烤面包
I've always said you can't beat bread and butter.

1062
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,520
爸爸 你怎么来这里了
Dad, you can get out of here.

1063
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,240
-别这么吃惊.. -不是我认真的
- Now, don't get dramatic.... - Nah, I mean it.

1064
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,120
我认真的爸爸快回去
I mean it, Dad, just go.

1065
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,920
-你成了封面女郎了 你知道吗 -什么
- You're quite the cover girl, do you know that? - What?

1066
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,160
上周你还是《回声》的头版
Well, front page of the Echo you were last week.

1067
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,000
"新冠疫情中的亡命鸳鸯"
00
"Covid on the run."

1068
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,920
你以为你能对我指手画脚吗
You think you're the one who's going to fuck it up for me?

1069
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,360
我记得奶奶带你来这里拖车旅行过
I remembered Nana took you caravanning round here once.

1070
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,440
一你把拖车的锁给撬了吗 -求你了回去吧
- Did you break into the vans? - Go away. Please.

1071
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,280
-回去吧 -你他妈的总爱作妖
- Please go away. - Always with the fucking drama!

1072
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,400
这是别人度假住的地方 别人的梦想啊
These are people's holidays, people's dreams.

1073
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,400
我们已经隔离了十天了
We've done ten days.

1074
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,280
只要再隔离四天就够了
We only need to do four more....

1075
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,880
我们只需坚持14天
We just need to get to 14 days

1076
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,120
然后我会要求他们重新安置他
and then l'll make them put him somewhere different.

1077
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,520
14天只要14天就行了不是吗
Well, for 14 days, that's all that matters, isn't it?

1078
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,320
他们会知道他没有得病然后我觉得
You know, they'll know he doesn't have it, then, and I think...

1079
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,080
我觉得他就能获准离开
I'm sure he will be allowed to go...

1080
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,400
他就会获准去个不一样的地方
He'll be allowed to go somewhere different.

1081
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,880
-你总是这么说 -因为你他妈的就是
- You always say that. - Because you fucking are!

1082
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,400
疫情开始之前我们有20个住户
We had 20 residents when this started.

1083
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,760
爸爸他们在一个一个地死去 一个接一个
They've been dying off, one by one, Dad.

1084
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,760
一想到放任他待在那里
The thought of leaving him like that...

1085
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,960
不食物就寻常吃的就行
No...Uh, food. Just normal food.

1086
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:05,440
一怎么了 -右脚噢 就这样
- What's going on? - Right foot. Ooh! There you go.

1087
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,800
再下左脚 下一步完美
Left foot down. Next step. Perfect.

1088
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,760
别太期待哦
Don't get your hopes up, all right?

1089
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,560
但还行你明白我的意思吗
But it's something, do you know what I mean?

1090
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,240
你要带我去哪里 去枪毙还是什么
Where are you taking me? To the firing squad or something?

1091
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,440
你知道怎么玩傻蛋纸牌吗
Do you know how to play shitter?

1092
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,080
这是给我的惊喜吗
Is this me surprise?

1093
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,400
你知道吗 我以前没怎么出过远门
Do you know? I've never done much of this before.

1094
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,320
一想到我们熟知的世界 就没兴致了
To think the world we know and it's all over.

1095
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,400
免轮班只为了一件事,0
Shift-free for one thing.

1096
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,360
我小时候出去度过假
We went on holiday when I was a kid.

1097
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,720
-峨多尼哥-对多尼哥

我妈妈有个堂姐
Yeah, me ma had a cousin.

1099
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,880
她死后留给了我们点钱
Left us some money when she died

1100
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,640
然后她突发奇想"管他的我们要去多尼哥"
and she just went, "Fuck it. We're going to Donegal."

1101
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,000
直到今天我都不清楚为什么是多尼哥
To this day, I don't know why it was Donegal.

1102
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,000
你们是跟特丽莎一起去的-对

Hasn't put me off you, though.

1114
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,320

1119

你可以不说话
You do not have to say anything.

1122
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,200
但如果你被讯问时不表态
Harm your defence

1123
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,000
将会不利于你日后在法庭上依据这件事
if you do not mention when questioned something

1124
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,720
你所说的任何话都可能作为证据

 这个国家就是这么运转的
It's the way this country works now.

1145
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:58,080
低个头看看那些被抛弃的人啊
You know, keep our eyes down to the rest of it.

1146
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,280
我们这种人看到饥饿的人排队领食物
You know, cos if we see people queueing up for food banks

看到流浪的人躺在 躺在大街上
and if we see people lying...Lying on the streets,

We can't cope. We can't cope with Tory. Not us.

从什么时候起我们的生命不再平等了
When did our lives stop being worth the same, eh?
